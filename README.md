# 3D-GameTest
:video_game: My first 3D game, the engine utilizes openGL 3D (Namely the Leadworks engine), it is merely a simple tech demo.


//-- 3D Game Demo Created with the Leadworks engine --//

The game might require openAL to run (If you are getting the openAL32.dll is missing error) thus the link to the download of openAL is below

http://www.openal.org/downloads/

Please do not hesitate to report any bugs or errors!

I will be updating the map a little in the future to include some open world elements and a skybox.

Best Regards and Enjoy!
